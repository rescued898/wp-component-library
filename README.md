Accessible simple tabs
=====================

this is a forked version of [10up components library](https://10up.github.io/wp-component-library/) tabs, which is a fork of [simply accessible work](http://simplyaccessible.com/).

I introduced the ability to pass more options, now you can pass all the classes so you're not limited
with the original class names.
some classes like is-active and m-is-active, were left

## Options

```
var options = {
  tabContent:   '.tab-content',
	tabsList:     '.tab-list',
	tabLinks:     '.tab-list li > a',
	activeTab:    '.tab-list li',
	tabItem:      '.tab-item'
}
```
